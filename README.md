hot-tabs
========

Google Chrome Extension that adds tab numbers to tab titles for easy use of keyboard shortcuts for tab switching.

'Example:   ``` __________                 _____________``` '
'A tab like ```|example x \``` becomes ```|2) example x \``` so you can use keyboard shortcuts to quickly navigate many tabs.'

###TODO:
* Get tab numbers to appear in Gmail and like pages.
* Stop tabs past 9 from upating, no point to go further.

###ISSUES:
* Does not update tabs for js generated titles such as Gmail. Tab numbers are still correct where displayed.
* Keeps updating tabs after 9, which is not terribly helpful for keyboard shortcuts.
